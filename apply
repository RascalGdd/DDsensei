My name is Diandian Guo, I'm a master student from University of Stuttgart in Germany. I'm looking for a position for internship. I would like to have some publications when doing the internship because I have a future PHD plan. So top institutes like MSRA would be my first choice. I searched for your publications and research areas in Internet and I'm interested in it. I did some reseach projects with a phd student in our uni about unsupervised semantic image synthesis using unpaired cityscapes dataset with GAN model. In another project, I implemented the mean-teacher algorithm to improve the model performance in a Zero-Shot diabetic retinopathy classification task. 

For myself, I am a top student in the uni, get full score in courses like deep learning, pattern recognition... I'm currently doing the internship about Lane detection in Bosch. I  am proactive and work very hard. I would say that I'm experienced in deep learning(and coding of course). And the most important thing is, I'm very easy going and flexible, I always have good relationship with my working partners and I have lots of free time to work and the working hours is not a problem for me. I would strongly recommend myself if you have some positions for good topics. Please give me a chance if possible! :D

I have attached my CV and transcript.

Best regards,
Diandian
